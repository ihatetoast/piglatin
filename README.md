#A refactored Pig Latin translator
[Pig Latin Translator on Surge](http://ihatetoast-piglatin.surge.sh)

##In the beginning ...
It was just a test for me to practice jQuery and all that jJazz. During my first attempt, I completely forgot about clusters, but it was late and I was going to return later.

##In the middle ...
I did a Free Code Camp algorithm for Pig Latin and dealt with the clusters. Now I had two different codes in two different locations.

##In the end ...
I made my own pig and corn with Sketch, changed the HTML/CSS a wee bit, and united my two codes. 

##What I'd add, change, or destroy ...
I'd like to add the ability to deal with punctuation, return a sentence with the first word capitalized, and add some margin to the bottom so that you don't have to scroll to see the text.
