# A refactored Pig Latin translator
[Pig Latin Translator](http://www.ihatetoast.com/piglatin/)

## In the beginning ...
It was just a test for me to practice jQuery and all that jJazz. During my first attempt, I completely forgot about clusters (i.e., "sh", "ch", "sch", "tsch", "th"), but it was late and I was going to return later.

## In the middle ...
I did a Free Code Camp algorithm for Pig Latin and dealt with the clusters. Now I had two different codes in two different locations.

## In the end ...
I wanted to unite my algorithm practicing with my Sketch-ucation (yeah, sorry).
I made my own pig and corn with Sketch, changed the HTML/CSS a wee bit, and united my two codes. 

## What I'd add, change, or destroy ...
I'd like to add the ability to deal with punctuation, return a sentence with the first word capitalized, and add some margin to the bottom so that you don't have to scroll to see the text. 

## Biggest challenge:
Letting go of my background in linguistics to just deal with the code.
