#A refactored Pig Latin translator
[Pig Latin Translator on Surge](https://ihatetoast.piglatin.surge.sh)

##In the beginning ...
It was just a test for me to practice jQuery and all that jJazz. During my first attempt, I completely forgot about clusters, but it was late and I was going to return later.

##In the middle ...
I did a Free Code Camp algorithm for Pig Latin and dealt with the clusters. Now I had two different codes in two different locations.

##In the end ...
I made my own pig and corn with Sketch, changed the HTML/CSS a wee bit, and united my two codes.
